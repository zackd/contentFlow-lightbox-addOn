Re-wrote the 'onclickActiveItem' function in ContentFlowAddOn_lightbox.js
Changed lightbox.css : added CSS transparency, and CSS3 box-shadow

it now opens images in the lightbox by default (no change here!), or opens a href (+ target param) if provided:

opens image in lightbox:

<a class="item">
    <img class="content" src="/media/xlsrc/images/indoor_show.jpg"  alt="indoor-show" />
    <span class="caption">indoor show</span>
</a>

opens link in new window:

 <a class="item" href="http://www.google.co.uk/" target="_blank">
    <img class="content" src="/media/xlsrc/images/indoor_show.jpg" alt="indoor-show" />
    <span class="caption">indoor show</span>
</a>

Was a bit tricky getting this to work smoothly in IE, but its good to go.
Tested roughly in IE6, IE7, Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox.
